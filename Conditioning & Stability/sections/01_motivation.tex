	\par Claiming the reliability of the results obtained from a numerical procedure is a concern of crucial importance in numerical analysis. To claim reliability, one needs to quantify the robustness of the inner components of the numerical procedure (i.e. problem definition, numerical algorithm) followed to compute the solution. Conditioning and stability are metrics that describe the robustness of these inner components. Both concepts try to answer the following question "How reliable is my numerical procedure?".
