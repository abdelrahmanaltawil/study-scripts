	 		Solving a problem numerically is heavily dependent on the how this problem is defined and the numerical algorithm used to solve it. Bad-construction of these elements will bring ill-behavior of the solution procedure, and hence false results. Conditioning and stability are quality measures for the construction of these elements. The former assess the construction of the problem definition, whereas the latter concerned with the construction of the algorithm. In this script we will explore the meaning of conditioning and stability more rigorously and their applications.
